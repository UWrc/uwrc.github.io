Our February maintenance is complete, and Klone is back in operation. The next maintenance is scheduled for **Tuesday March 11, 2025** (AKA the 2nd Tuesday of the month). 

### Notable Updates
* 

### Upcoming Training

**Hyak: Advanced Slurm** - This workshop will be held in person on **Wednesday February 26 10am - 11:45am in the eScience Classroom** (Address: WRF Data Science Studio, UW Physics/Astronomy Tower, 6th Floor; 3910 15th Ave NE, Seattle, WA 98195). For this tutorial, we'll use this container and a  [**publicly available dataset**](https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.12056) to practice submitting single and array jobs to Hyak's job scheduler, Slurm. [**Locator**](https://elifesciences.org/articles/54507) is [**set of python tools**](https://github.com/kr-colab/locator.git) that builds a neural network with TensorFlow to estimate the location of organisms based on their genotype (DNA; or genetic background). The neural network is trained on genotypes from a set of organisms with known location. Performance is assessed with “unknown origin” genotypes by calculating the distance between their predicted and true location.

### New training video uploaded 

[**Hyak: Open OnDemand recording from training on January 31**](https://youtu.be/U_LlktlDyI4?si=K2tctaFCc-bGonOQ). [**Open OnDemand (OOD)**](https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/ood/start) is an open-source web portal for HPC centers to provide users with an easy-to-use web interface to HPC clusters. For the last year, the Hyak team has been adding features to OOD. This workshop demonstrates OOD's main features such as exploring the filesystem, composing jobs, and launching interactive applications like Jupyter, Rstudio, MATLAB, and Virtual Desktop.

If you would like to request 1 on 1 help, please send an email to **help@uw.edu** with "Hyak Office Hour" in the subject line to coordinate a meeting.

### Opportunities

* **COMPLECS: Linux Tools for Text Processing** - Many computational and data processing workloads require pre-processing of input files to get the data into a format that is compatible with the user’s application and/or post-processing of output files to extract key results for further analysis. While these operations could be done by hand, they tend to be time-consuming, tedious and, worst of all, error prone. In this session we cover the Linux tools awk, sed, grep, sort, head, tail, cut, paste, cat and split, which will help users to easily automate repetitive tasks. We conclude by showing how large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT could be used to write commands using these tools.

* **The Trusted CI Student Program** offers undergraduate and graduate students invaluable hands-on experience, mentorship, and opportunities to contribute to a secure and resilient digital future. As cybersecurity becomes an essential component of the scientific community, this program empowers students to gain the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in the field. The Trusted CI Student Program offers a unique opportunity for students eager to advance in the cybersecurity field. Applications for the 2025 cohort open on February 3, 2025. [**Click here for more details on how to apply and program information**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdd7uiwJH4mqI13w5sc2LXlY9Zt-6l9mSiIb5AwYzsEdwjwUg/viewform?usp=header). 

* **Google Cloud Skills Boost** seats are available to the UW community. This platform offers online courses, labs, and certifications to help learners develop cloud skills. If you are interested in using this excellent learning resource, please request access via email to Rob Fatland at **rob5@uw.edu**. 

* **Join the Bridge to Ocean Acoustics and Technology (BOAT) workshop** and learn ocean acoustics from theory to data practice with Jupyter notebooks! The workshop is organized as part of the BOAT program which aims to grow the ocean acoustics education and research community through open-source curriculum and is funded by the ONR. Application deadline Thursday, February 20th. [**Apply HERE**](https://boat-ocean-acoustics.github.io/)! 

* The [**Nawaz Lab**](https://www.nawazinnovation.com/) at the UW-Applied Physics Laboratory is currently looking for a student to help apply machine learning to long term sensor data with the goal of correcting for drift. Contact Anuscheh Nawaz at **anuscheh@uw.edu** for more details. 

* [**The Microsoft AI for Good Open Call**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/ai-for-good-lab-open-call/) supports individuals and organizations creating positive change in Washington State Program, providing opportunities for scientific collaboration with the Microsoft AI for Good Lab. Application deadline: Monday, February 17th. [**APPLY**](https://webportalapp.com/sp/login/msr_2025_ai_for_good_lab_open_call)

* **Text Mining Student Assistant** - This student position, jointly supported by the Open Scholarship Commons and eScience, will provide technical expertise on text mining and natural language processing (NLP) to UW researchers at all levels. [**Apply NOW**](https://lib.uw.edu/about/employment/students/text-mining/)
