Our December maintenance is complete. Thank you for your patience. The next maintenance will be **Tuesday January 14, 2025**. 

### Notable Updates
* Updated node images, ensuring the security and behavior you expect from Hyak `klone`.
* We migrated LMOD modules and other tools and software stored in `/mmfs1/sw/` to Solid State Drives (SSDs). Users may notice increased speed of modules.

### Office Hours over Winter Break

I will continue to hold **Zoom office hours** on Wednesdays at 2pm throughout December. Attendees need only register once and can attend any of the occurrences with the Zoom link that will arrive via email. [**Click here to Register for Zoom Office Hours.**](https://washington.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJMpce6vrz8sEtR5miKvhsQiXANt6lBORFTu)

December 12 will be the last **in-person office hours** for Fall term to be held at 2pm at the eScience Institute (address: WRF Data Science Studio, UW Physics/Astronomy Tower, 6th Floor, 3910 15th Ave NE, Seattle, WA 98195). In-person office hours will resume on Thursdays at 2pm starting January 9, 2025. 
 
If you would like to request 1 on 1 help, please send an email to **help@uw.edu** with "Hyak Office Hour" in the subject line to coordinate a meeting.

### Research Computing Club Officer Nominations
The Research Computing Club (RCC) at UW is looking for nominations for Officer positions. The RCC provides essential computational resources to support students working on a wide range of research projects using high-performance computing through UW’s Hyak system and cloud platforms like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. The RCC relies on student officers to continue providing these resources to the UW community and to organize community-driven events such as Hackathons and trainings.
Officer positions are:
* President
* Director of AI/ML
* Director of Outreach
* Director of Hyak
* Director of Cloud Computing

Please consider nominating yourself if you are interested, or nominating someone you know who is interested, by [**filling out the form linked HERE**](https://forms.gle/GEWJsNFzptJ9tnhx7).

### External Opportunities

 [**DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellowship**](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/about-doe-csgf/news-events/apply-now)- Applications are being accepted through January 16, 2025 for the Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (DOE CSGF). Candidates must be U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents who plan full-time, uninterrupted study toward a Ph.D. at an accredited U.S. university.

The DOE CSGF is composed of two computational science tracks. Eligible fellowship candidates should carefully review the criteria for both tracks prior to initiating the application process:
* The Science & Engineering Track accepts doctoral students engaged in computational science research with a science or engineering focus.
* The Mathematics/Computer Science Track accepts students pursuing research in broadly applicable methods and technology for high-performance computing (HPC) systems. 

Students applying to the Mathematics/Computer Science Track must be pursuing a doctoral degree in applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, computer engineering or computational science — in one of these departments or their academic equivalent. A departmental exception is made for students whose research is focused on algorithms or software for quantum information systems and who are enrolled in a science or engineering field. In all cases, research must contribute to more effective use of emerging HPC systems.

[**DOE NNSA Stewardship Science Graduate Fellowship**](https://www.krellinst.org/ssgf/about-doe-nnsa-ssgf/news-events/apply-now)- Applications are being accepted through January 14, 2025 for the Department of Energy National Nuclear Security Administration Stewardship Science Graduate Fellowship (DOE NNSA SSGF). Candidates must be U.S. citizens who plan full-time, uninterrupted study toward a Ph.D. at an accredited U.S. university.

The DOE NNSA SSGF provides doctoral students with in-depth training in areas relevant to stewardship of the nation's nuclear stockpile: high energy density physics, nuclear science, or materials under extreme conditions. Senior undergraduates and first- or second-year doctoral students are eligible to apply.

[**DOE NNSA Laboratory Residency Graduate Fellowship**](https://www.krellinst.org/lrgf/about-doe-nnsa-lrgf/fields-study)- As part of its science and national security missions, the U.S. Department of Energy National Nuclear Security Administration (DOE NNSA) supports a spectrum of basic and applied research in science and engineering at the agency's national laboratories, at universities and in industry.

Because of its continuing needs, the NNSA seeks candidates who demonstrate the skills and potential to form the next generation of leaders in the following fields via the DOE NNSA LRGF program:
* Engineering and Applied Sciences
* Physics
* Materials
* Mathematics and Computational Science
To meet its primary objective of encouraging the training of scientists, the DOE NNSA LRGF program provides financial support to talented students who accompany their study and research with [practical work experience](https://www.krellinst.org/lrgf/doe-lab-residency) at one or more of the following DOE NNSA facilities: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories or the Nevada National Security Site.

[**NSF ACCESS Student Training and Engagement Program (STEP)**](https://operations.access-ci.org/step) - Applications due February 15.
 * **STEP 1**: 2-week introductory experience - Join a dynamic two-week experience in Miami, FL in May! Travel, accommodations, and stipend included. This program is designed to help you:
    * Become more aware of the many areas of interest within the field: web programming, high performance computing, cybersecurity, networking, real use of AI.
    * Determine where your interests are.
    * Discover what areas of study you should pursue in the future.
    * Experience high levels of direct interaction with diverse people with diverse skill sets.

* **STEP-2**: Full-time for the summer (in-person + virtual) - follows STEP-1 Travel and accommodations covered for in-person events as well as a stipend for participating plus includes travel to a national conference. This program is designed to help you:
    * Develop an intermediate understanding of one of the areas of interest within the field: web programming, high performance computing, cybersecurity, networking, real use of AI.
    * Provide opportunities for interactions with professionals in the field.

* **STEP-3**: Part-time during the school year, follows STEP-2. Continue interacting (virtually) with your team on projects on a part-time basis during the academic year. Participants will receive a stipend and travel to the annual Supercomputing conference (SC25 in St. Louis, MO, USA). This program is designed to help you:
    * Develop a deep understanding of one of the areas of interest within the field: web programming, high performance computing, cybersecurity, networking, real use of AI.
    * Provide further opportunities for interactions with professionals in the field.

Understand how a career in cyberinfrastructure could fit with your future plans!
