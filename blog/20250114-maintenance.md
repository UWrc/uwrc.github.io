Hello Hyak Community,

Our January maintenance is complete, and Klone is back in operation. The next maintenance is scheduled for **Tuesday February 11, 2025** (AKA the 2nd Tuesday of the month). 

### Notable Updates
* **Slurm update**: We updated to version 24.11.0. If any user software was built against the older Slurm libraries (e.g., openmpi), then users may experience errors, and it may be necessary to rebuild their software against the newer Slurm libraries. 
* **Compute node updates**: The compute node OS images were updated to address any security patches in underlying core packages. 
* **Mathematica module installed** using the license maintained by the UW Physics Department. [**Learn how to launch Mathematica on Hyak**](https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/tools/matemathica/).  
* **MATLAB application** has been added to Hyak Open OnDemand Beta. [**Learn how to launch MATLAB with Open OnDemand**](https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/ood/matlab).  

### Upcoming Training
**Hyak: Open OnDemand** â€“ [**Open OnDemand (OOD) is an open-source web portal**](https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/ood/start) for HPC centers to provide users with an easy-to-use web interface to HPC clusters. For the last year, the Hyak team has been adding features to OOD. This workshop will demonstrate OOD's main features such as exploring the filesystem, composing jobs, and launching interactive applications like Jupyter. This workshop will be held in person 10am - 11:30am on Friday January 31, 2025 in CSE2 (Gates Center) Room 371 (3800 E Stevens Way NE, Seattle, WA 98195).

### Opportunities

**The eScience Institute offers the annual Winter School** to students and lecturers interested in developing basic skills and knowledge of the tools used in data science. Gaining literacy in topics such as Python, R, Jupyter, and reproducible environments can be beneficial beyond STEM, including areas like global or public health, public policy, social sciences, social work, international relations, and business management. Apply by January 24, 2025. [**Learn more!**](https://escience.washington.edu/data-science-learning/data-science-at-uw/winter-school/) 

**Summer Internship Opportunity at Purdue** - The Rosen Center for Advanced Computing (RCAC) is seeking students for Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) paid internships for an 11-week onsite summer REU program. This program aims at developing the next generation workforce in advanced computing and cyberinfrastructure technologies. It offers students from diverse backgrounds the opportunity to gain the knowledge and skills necessary to build and support advanced research computing systems and scientific applications. As part of RCAC's decade long successful student apprentice program, the REU students will learn by doing, working on the National Science Foundation funded Anvil system in a team environment and mentored by cyberinfrastructure professionals. Open to undergraduate students from all backgrounds and undergraduate programs within and beyond Purdue. Each student will present their work to Purdue staff, faculty, students, collaborators, and researchers at the end of the program. Students may present at a national conference as part of the program. This onsite program at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana runs from May through August. [**Learn more and apply NOW!**](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/anvil/reu) Interviews start in January! 

April 2-3, 2025, for **AI Unlocked: Empowering Higher Education through Research and Discovery**, a workshop designed for individuals across all disciplines and career stages in higher education. This workshop provides access to cutting-edge computational resources and expertise to researchers, students, faculty, and practitioners, especially those from Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs). Hosted by the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) Pilot User Experience Working Group, this event introduces AI fundamentals, hands-on experience with pre-configured AI tasks, and guidance for tailoring AI models to your projects. Travel support is available for selected participants to the Westin Denver Downtown, and virtual attendance options are also offered. [**Apply now to advance your AI skills and collaboration in higher education**](https://nairrpilot.org/ai-unlocked). Apply by January 31, 2025. Acceptances will be notified by the end of February. 
 
**The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) Alaska Center for Energy and Power (ACEP) summer internship** is a 10-week program for students to gain hands-on research experience and skill development in the energy industry. Our program offers two internship strands: AUSI and REU. Regardless of strand, all interns will receive: 
* A specific research project with 1:1 mentorship from an ACEP researcher 
* Collaborative workspace at ACEP 
* Travel to and from Alaska 
* Field trips related to energy in Alaska 

[**Applications due January 24, 2025.**](https://www.uaf.edu/acep/education-workforce-development/summer-internship-program/internship-program.php)
