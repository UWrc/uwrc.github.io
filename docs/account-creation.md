### I am a PI, but I'm not ready to purchase a slice yet.

Hyak no-cost demonstration accounts are intended for prospective slice owners to use the Hyak resources and assess whether the resources can serve their research computing needs. 

[**Click here to apply for a Hyak Demonstration Account.**](https://uwconnect.uw.edu/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=f5caba8fdbe108101ba12968489619e0)

The account has some limits and not all features of Hyak will be available for demonstration, but you will be able to test workflows and software on the cluster. [**Please note the limitations of Hyak demonstration accounts listed below.**](https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/account-creation#limitations-of-demo-accounts) 

### I have a PI and the PI contributed Hyak nodes.

Your PI can create a Hyak account for you by adding you to their group account. Refer to the previous section about [**adding users to a group**](/docs/join-group).

### I have a PI and we have no Hyak nodes.

[**Click here to apply for a Hyak Demonstration Account.**](https://uwconnect.uw.edu/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=f5caba8fdbe108101ba12968489619e0) Please provide your UW netID. [**Please note the limitations of Hyak demonstration accounts listed below.**](https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/account-creation#limitations-of-demo-accounts) If your PI has purchased Hyak storage you will need them to follow the step above to be <a href="https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/join-group">**added to the group**</a> to gain access to your shared data storage on the cluster after you're able to log in.

### I'm a UW student and I have no PI.

If you are a UW Student Technology Fee (STF) paying student, which includes almost every UW student, you are eligible to join the Research Computing Club (RCC). The RCC has a pool of resources on the Hyak cluster for you to use. [**Click here to learn how to join the RCC and secure a Hyak account**](https://depts.washington.edu/uwrcc/hyak_access/) and use their resource capacity on the cluster. 

### I am an external collaborator or I have no UWNetID.

Having aUW NetID is a pre-requisite for any type of Hyak account. If you are an external collaborator of a current Hyak user and need a UWNetID, you will need your UW collaborator sponsor you for a NetID. [**Click here to learn more about sponsored NetIDs**](https://itconnect.uw.edu/security/uw-netids/about-uw-netids/about-sponsored-uw-netids/). With your sponsored NetID, you can be added to a group or get a Demonstration account. 

### Limitations of Demo Accounts

Demonstration accounts are subject to the following restrictions:
* Jobs may only be submitted to the <a href="https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/compute/checkpoint#the-checkpoint-partition">**ckpt, ckpt-g2, or ckpt-all partitions**</a>.
* Storage is limited under the demo account to <a href="https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/storage/gscratch#user-home-directory">**10GB in the home directory**</a>. For additional temporary storage you may utilize <a href="https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/storage/gscratch#scrubbed"> **/gscratch/scrubbed storage**</a>. Be aware that files in scrubbed not used for several months will be deleted. This storage in not intended for large datasets, but can be helpful as you try out workflows on Hyak.
* You may submit as many jobs as you like, but the scheduler will only allow one to run at a time.
* Your jobs are limited to 80 cores, 360 GB of memory, 2 GPUs, and a maximum of 2 discrete nodes.

If you intend to purchase slices and are unable to test your workflows to your satisfaction, <a href="mailto:help@uw.edu?subject=hyak support">**please click here to open a support ticket**</a> explaining the features you would like to test before purchasing slices, and we will find a way to accomedate you.
