## What is Open OnDemand?

Open OnDemand (OOD) [[www](https://openondemand.org/)] is a web-based portal that provides an integrated, single access point for access to the Klone HPC Cluster. OOD provides a graphical user interface (GUI) as an alternative to the command line that simplifes the process of submitting jobs, managing files, launching applications, and monitoring job status.

## Accessing OOD

In order to access OOD you need to have an account on the Hyak cluster. If you don't have an account, check out our documentation [here](https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/account-creation).


:::info

If you access OOD from off campus, you will need to connect to the UW VPN. You can find instructions on how to connect to the UW VPN [here](https://itconnect.uw.edu/tools-services-support/networks-connectivity/husky-onnet/installing-configuring-and-using-husky-onnet/).
